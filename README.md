# avg

This is a tool for measuring the average duration of your console commands.

[![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/jonbaldie/avg/tree/main.svg?style=shield)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/jonbaldie/avg/tree/main)

## Usage

Pass in two arguments: your console command and then the number of iterations. 

```bash
avg "curl -o /dev/null http://example.com" 5
```

This runs your `curl` command five times and returns the average time elapsed in seconds:

```
Average elapsed time: 0.1610317872s
```
