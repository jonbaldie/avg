# avg

This is a tool for measuring the average duration of your console commands.

Pass in two arguments: your console command and then the number of iterations. 

```bash
./avg "curl -o /dev/null http://example.com" 5
```

This runs your `curl` command five times and returns the average time elapsed in seconds:

```
Average elapsed time: 0.1610317872s
```
